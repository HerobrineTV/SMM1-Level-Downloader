# SMM1-Level-Downloader
A Super Mario Maker 1 Level Downloader designed for the Use of the WayBackMachines Level Collection

# Decompilation
To Decompile the Levels I used ASH Extractor which is already In this Repository
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/ASH_Extractor

# First time setup
For the first time setup u need to install axios
"npm install axios"

# Usage
Just open up the Programm and Search your Favourite Curses, which u then can easily Download!

It should then try to get that level and decompile it for you.

# How does this work?
It just downloads the Level via Archive.org since theres alot or almost every level stored mentioned in this Post
