# Announcement
I am currently createing a whole UI System with Settings and Level Search using ElectronJS
If u got any feature requests Dm me on Discord: nintendo_switch

# SMM1-Level-Downloader
A Super Mario Maker 1 Level Downloader designed for the Use of the WayBackMachines Level Collection

# Decompilation
To Decompile the Levels I used ASH Extractor which is already In this Repository
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/ASH_Extractor

# First time setup
For the first time setup u need to install axios
"npm install axios"

# Usage
Just open up the Programm and Search your Favourite Curses, which u then can easily Download!
It should then try to get that level and decompile it for you.

# How does this work?
I packed my ElectronJS Application into a .exe format by using electron-packager, just run unzip the .zip File from the Releases

It gathers the Archive.org download link for the Searched Level from my Database.

Then it is downloading it from Archive.org
(Information here: https://archive.org/details/super_mario_maker_courses_202105)

After that u can View it in Saved Levels in the Programm.
There u will be able to see the Curse display. Which was only possible through Leo's Course Viewer, which he allowed me to implement!
(https://github.com/leomaurodesenv/smm-course-viewer)
Big thanks to him!

Now u can Press the "Open Folder" Button and u will see all your Saved Levels.

Just copy the inside of the folders in your desired Mario Maker 1 Savefile in one of the course files.

# Important Note
U have to createthe course Files ingame and not by creating a Folder, else they wont show up!
